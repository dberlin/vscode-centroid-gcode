# VSCode GCode language support

Provides real language support for G-Code.
The exact variant of G-Code is that used by Centroid's CNC12 software.
This is a pretty standard G-Code variant, so the hover help should be useful for most other vendors.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Hover help for macro variables, G-codes, and M-Codes
- Symbol auto completion
- Reference finding

## Getting help
If you have any questions, issues, or concerns, feel free to file an issue on the github repository.

**Enjoy!**
