A G51 applies scaling/mirror to all positions, lines, and arcs following this G-code, until a G50 is entered. Specify scaling factors with a value I, J, K. The X, Y, and Z parameters are the coordinates of the scaling center. If the scaling center is not specified, the default scaling center is the current cutter position as shown on the DRO. To mirror, enter a negative value for the scaling factor.\n\nExample, Scaling:\n```\nG51 X0.0 Y0.0 Z0.0 I3.0 J2 K1 ; turn scaling on\nG00 X0.0 Y0.0 Z1.0 ; rapid to X0, Y0, Z1\nG01 X1.0 Y0.0 Z1.0 ; line to X1, Y0, Z1\nG01 X1.0 Y1.0 Z1.0 ; line to X1, Y1, Z1\nG01 X0.0 Y1.0 Z1.0 ; line to X0, Y1, Z1\nG01 X0.0 Y0.0 Z1.0 ; line to X0, Y0, Z1\nG01 X0.0 Y0.0 Z0.0 ; line to X0, Y0, Z0\nG50 ; cancel scale\n```\nFor this G51, the following program lines were scaled 3:1 in the X direction, 2:1 in the Y direction, and 1:1 in the Z direction. If no scale factor is specified, the default is 1:1 for all axes.\n\nExample, Mirroring:\n```\nG51 X-0.5 Y0.0 Z.0 I-1 J1 K1 ; turn mirror on (x axis -0.5 mirror\n                             ; line)\nG00 X0.0 Y0.0 Z1.0 ; rapid traverse to X0, Y0, Z1\nG01 X1.0 Y0.5 Z1.0 ; line to X1, Y.5, Z1\nG01 X0.0 Y1.0 Z1.0 ; line to X0, Y1, Z1\nG01 X0.0 Y0.0 Z1.0 ; line to X0, Y0, Z1\nG50 ; cancel mirror\n```\nIf an arc is scaled with uneven scaling factors, the result will depend on how the arc center and radius were specified:\n\n",

A subprogram is a separate program that can be used to perform a certain operation (e.g. a drilling pattern, contour, etc.) many times throughout a main program.\n\nCalling methods:\n\n```\nM98 Pxxxx Lrrrr OR\nM98 ”program.cnc” Lrrrr\n```\n\nwhere xxxx is the subprogram number (referring to file Oxxxx.cnc, 9100-9999 allowed, leading 0’s required in filename, capital O, lowercase .cnc), rrrr is the repeat value, and ”program.cnc” is the name of the subprogram file.\n\nSubprograms are written just like normal programs, with one exception: an M99 should be at the end of the subprogram. M99 transfers control back to the calling program.\n\nSubprograms can call other subprograms (up to 20 nested levels of calling may be used), Macro M-functions, and Macros. Macro M-functions and Macros can similarly call subprograms.\n\nSubprograms 9100-9999 can also be embedded into a main program, using O9xxx to designate the beginning of the subprogram and M99 to end it. The CNC software will read the subprogram and generate a file O9xxx.cnc. The CNC will not execute the subprogram until it encounters M98 P9xxx.\n\nNOTE: An embedded subprogram definition must be placed before any calls to the subprogram.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose that a drilling pattern of 4 holes is needed in 3 different locations:\n\n```\n:Main program\nG90 G0 X2 Y5 Z0.5 ;Move to first hole pattern\nM98 P9101 L1 ;Call subprogram O9101.cnc\nG90 G0 X4Y1 Z0.5 ;Move to second hole pattern\nM98 P9101 L1 ;Call subprogram\nG90 G0 X6 Y5 Z0.5 ;Move to third hole pattern\nM98 P9101 L1 ;Call subprogram\n:End program\n```\n\nThe main program would call this subprogram three times:\n```\nO9101 ;Program O9101.cnc\nG91 F10 ;Incremental positioning\nG81 X0 Y0 R -.4 Z-.6 ;Drill lower left hole\nY1.5 R -.4 Z-.6 ;Drill upper left hole\nX1 R -.4 Z-.6 ;Drill upper right hole\nY-1.5 R-.4 Z-.6 ;Drill lower right hole\nG80 ;Cancel canned cycles\nM99 ;End of subprogram\n```\n\nExample:\n\nAnother example is ”looping” or consecutively repeating a section of code. Here, the subprogram will be part of the main program.\n\n```\n:Main program\nG90 G0 X0 Y0 Z0.1\nG1 Z0 F30\nO9100 ;Beginning of subprogram\nG91 G1 Z-0.1 F5\nG90 X2 F30 Y2\nX0 Y0\nM99 ;End of subprogram 9100\nM98 P9100 L3 ;Repeat O9100 3 times\nM25 G49 ;End main program\n```\n\n",

Any comment that appeared on the line with M122 will be outputted after the position(s). With no axis arguments, M122 will write the positions of all installed axes. With axis arguments, it will write the positions only of the requested axes. Positions will be written in local (not machine) coordinates, in native machine units. If no data file has been opened with M120 or M121 before M122 is called, then M122 will return an error and terminate the job. The parameter L1 may be used to suppress the new line character normally outputted after the last position. Furthermore, the output of axis labels, comma separators, and spaces can be enabled or suppressed via machine parameter 72 (see Parameter 72 in Chapter 14). If the control has been configured to use a DSP probe type, using parameter Q1 will write the values stored in #24301-#24305 to the file.\n\nExample: M function and sample output:\n\n|M122 ;comment|->|X1.2345 Y-3.2109 Z-0.5678 ;comment|\n|:---|:---|:---|\n|M122 /X L1|->|X-1.5000|\n|M122 /X|->|X-1.5000 X-2.0000|\n",
